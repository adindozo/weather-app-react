Weather is something that never remains constant. Getting to know precise weather conditions helps people to plan out their daily schedule. With weather forecasting technology reaching to the skies, dissemination of the forecast to has taken diverse routes. Weather application enable users to get instant information about weather conditions. Since Sarajevo is my hometown, I made an application that shows it's weather. This app was created using React framework. The slider can be used to see hourly forecast. https://openweathermap.org supplied me with JSON data via their API.
